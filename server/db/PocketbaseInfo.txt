While I wouldnt include the applications database raw data, installing and using pocketbase is easier than sql for sure, if youd' want to use
grab the exe based on sys architecture.

https://pocketbase.io/docs/

then follow docs, but a quick use would be to nav to /pb and run ./pocketbase serve, then wire anything in node to its address,
which is just localhost in dev. 

In my app, pocketbase is a systemctl service that I needed to create so that it will run when the server itself restarts. It pretty customizable and
can be used for much more than just storing data, as I use it as a simple auth system as well.
